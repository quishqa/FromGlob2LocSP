# WRF-Chem model evaluation

Here are the scripts to to evaluate WRF-Chem performance against CETESB measurements.

* `domain_plots.py`: Script to plot WRF-Chem domains, with topography information,
and their location on the globe.
* `met_verification_d02.py`: Script to calculate performance statistics and to plot model **meteorological** results vs CETESB measurements.
* `pol_verification_d02.py`: Script to calculate performance statistics and to plot model **air quality** results vs CETESB measurements.
* `pol_spatial_d02.py`: Script to plot mean model air quality results (contourf) and CETESB mean measurements (dots) , mean bias spatial distribution, and Pearson correlation coefficient spatial distribution.
