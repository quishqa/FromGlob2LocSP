# CAM-Chem model evaluation

Here are the script to evaluate CAM-Chem performance against CETESB measurements.
CAM-Chem simulation were retrieve from [this site](https://www.acom.ucar.edu/cam-chem/cam-chem.shtml).

* `CAM_MZ4_domains.py`: Plot MOZART-4 vs CAM-Chem CO results to see the difference in spatial resolution.
* `South_America_cam_chem_plots.py`: Plot pollutants surface mean for South America.
* `cam_chem_temporal_plots.py`: Comparison between CAM-Chem results vs CETESB measurements.
